# FReTS
Developing Fly Real-time Transcription Scope

## Introduction
**FReTS** (**F**ly **Re**al-time **T**ranscription **S**cope) is an interdisciplinary platform which utilizes the real-time tracking system to interact with the animals' transcription activity hence possible behaviors via closed-loop control system, combined with external interferences, such as laser/light stimulation, odour delivery, electric shock, etc.
